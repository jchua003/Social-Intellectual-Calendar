To mark the 150th anniversary of the League, The New York Historical showcases works by League affiliates with featured paintings drawn from The Historical’s promised gift of 130 scenes of New York City from art collectors and philanthropists Elie and Sarah Hirschfeld.

This intimate guided tour will feature a selection of The Art Students League artists and teachers including Theresa Bernstein, Reginald Marsh, Michiyo Fukushima, Stuart Davis and Ben Shahn amongst others.
