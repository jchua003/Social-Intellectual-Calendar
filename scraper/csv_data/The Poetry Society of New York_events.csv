It originates in the South African disability rights movement in the 1990s, and has become a global rallying cry. In this generative workshop we will explore the political demands of disabled people and how those demands intersect with other experiences of marginalization and/or oppression. Attendees will study poetry by disabled people and you will be invited to write toward your own relationship to a disability politic.For this generative workshop, we will define disability as physical, intellectual, emotional, developmental, or psychological conditions that impact daily life. This workshop will center the lived experience of disabled people and is open to people of all abilities.",7 AM PST,Online

","In this generative workshop, we will consider poems that engage and manipulate playful forms (for instance, a choose your own adventure, a classified ad, a repetitive form). Attendees will then use these examples to inspire their own experiments, considering routes to writing poems through games, jokes, and other sites of play. We will additionally discuss opportunities to amplify the text on the page through its performance, and push the boundaries between performance and the written word—considering how one might share a poem that is in some way ""impossible."" All attendees will have the opportunity to share their experiments.",7 AM PST,Online

Workshop,"July 18, 2025",PSNY Virtual Workshop: How to End a Poem,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/psny-virtual-workshop-how-to-end-a-poem-tickets-1375226121349?aff=erelpanelorg,"About the Instructor: Mary Helen Callier is the author of When the Horses (Alice James Books, 2025).

She received her MFA from Washington University in St. Louis, and is currently an instructor and doctoral candidate in English and Literary Arts at the University of Denver, where she serves as one of the poetry editors for Denver Quarterly.","Poetry is full of familiar adages: we are often told to end with an image, to show rather than tell. How can we take these adages and generatively invert them? In this workshop we are going to examine poems that combine the lyric power of image with the rhetorical force of pronouncement. We will look at poems by Sandra Lim, Carl Phillips, and Sara Nicholson to explore what generative associations, ambiguities, and resonances can occur in the gap between an image and its explanation, and we will consider how to pattern these moments in our own work. We will work together to generate two lists: one of statements, declarations, and pronouncements, and one of images. We will consider how these lists inflect and inform each other, and how we might work with them to build a poem.",7 AM PST,Online

We'll read and discuss poems that employ juxtapositions of diction, tone, and image to lead both the poet and the reader to unexpected insights and unforgettable artistry. Most of all, we'll study how juxtaposition can guide participants in the writing, revision, and expansion of their original work.",7 AM PST,Online
Special Event,"July 31, 2025",Summer Virtual Poetry Intensive: The Shared World,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/summer-virtual-poetry-intensive-the-shared-world-tickets-1407846630169?aff=ebdsoporgprofile,"Welcome to PSNY’s Summer Virtual Intensive:“The Shared World”— a seven-week journey where you will delve into Intimacy, Address, and the Possibilities of the Second Person.","No poet writes alone. Every poetic act is a relational act—a voice motivated to emerge from the void to address the self, the beloved, the stranger, the reader, the collective, or the future. How do poems embody our need for entanglement and our experiences with alienation? Taking its title from a poem by Vivee Franis, in this course we’ll consider how playing with the second-person in our writing can reveal and reflect the complexity of our grief, rage, joy, and desire.

We’ll read poems by Aracelis Girmay, Danez Smith, Matthew Olzmann, Solmaz Sharif, and others. We’ll write poems that create opportunities for us to speak, and be spoken to, in new ways.

**No prior experience with theory or workshops is needed—just come excited and ready to learn.**
