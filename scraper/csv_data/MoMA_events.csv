Directed by Spike Lee,https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/10650,"Crooklyn (1994), directed by Spike Lee and co-written with his siblings, is a nostalgic, heartfelt portrait of a young girl’s coming of age in 1970s Fort Greene, Brooklyn. One of Lee’s most personal films, it blends warmth, humor, and striking visuals by Arthur Jafa.","Crooklyn. 1994. USA. Directed by Spike Lee. Screenplay by Joie Susannah Lee, Cinqué Lee, and Spike Lee. With Alfre Woodard, Delroy Lindo, Spike Lee, Zelda Harris. 35mm print courtesy NBC/Universal. In English. 115 min.

Although the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Fort Greene has a history of repertory programming dating back to the 1970s, the performing arts organization made a major commitment to year-round cinema under the leadership of Harvey Lichtenstein and Karen Brooks Hopkins, founding the four-screen BAMCinema in 1998, with three screens devoted to arthouse programming and one, the BAMCinematek, to repertory screenings and festivals. With consulting programmers Dan Talbot and Adrienne Mancia, and the full-time programmer Florence Almozini, BAM quickly established itself as one of the city’s most important film venues. Past programmers include Jacob Perlin, Nellie Killian, Gabriel Caroti, David Reilly, Ashley Clarke, and Gina Duncan (who was also BAM president). The current head of programming is Jesse Trussell. Spike Lee—who is not just one of the world’s most prolific and singular directors but was also a long-time Fort Greene resident who established his company 40 Acres and a Mule in the neighborhood—has been a frequent guest at BAM. He was the subject of the 1999 retrospective that opened BAM Cinematek, and another retrospective in 2014. Crooklyn, his most directly personal film, and among his most beautiful (with widescreen cinematography by Arthur Jafa), is a childhood memoir about growing up in Fort Greene, cowritten by Spike Lee with his sister Joie Susannah Lee and brother Cinqué Lee.",4:00 p.m.,"MoMA, Floor T2/T1, Theater 2

Lushly shot and formally bold, the film marked the opening of MoMI’s First Look festival.","La Folie Almayer (Almayer's Folly). 2011. Belgium/France. Directed by Chantal Akerman. Screenplay by Akerman, based on the novel by Joseph Conrad. With Stanislas Merhar, Aurora Marion, Marc Barbe. 35mm print courtesy Royal Film Archive of Belgium. In French and English, with subtitles. 127 min.

The Museum of the Moving Image launched First Look, its annual festival of formally inventive new international cinema, in 2012. Programmed by Dennis Lim, Rachael Rakes, and chief curator David Schwartz, the 2012 edition opened with Almayer’s Folly, directed by Chantal Akerman, who was the subject of a complete film retrospective at MoMI in 1997. Of Almayer’s Folly, Schwartz wrote: “Akerman’s masterful and mesmerizing Almayer’s Folly freely adapts Joseph Conrad’s first novel. A European trader’s dreams of striking it rich in Malaysia have faded; all he has is his ruptured relationship with his half-Malay daughter. From its straddling opening—the stabbing of an entertainer at an outdoor music bar to Dean Martin’s ‘Sway’—the film unfolds with trancelike power. Beautifully photographed in thick jungle terrain, Almayer’s Folly synthesizes the long-take formalism of Akerman’s earlier work with the spontaneity of her documentaries; it is as much influenced by F. W. Murnau and Robert Flaherty’s Tabu as it is by Conrad.” Other directors featured on First Look opening nights include Bruno Dumont (Outside Satan), Alexandre Rockwell (Little Feet), Jessica Hausner (Amour Fou), Alexander Sokurov (Francofonia), Hirokazu Kore-eda (After the Storm), Blake Williams (PROTOTYPE), and Serge Loznitsa (Donbass).",7:00 p.m.,"MoMA, Floor T2/T1, Theater 2

In French and Wolof with English subtitles. 115 min.

Presented by Film at Lincoln Center (formerly the Film Society of Lincoln Center), the prestigious New York Film Festival was founded in 1963. It was not until 1991 that Film at Lincoln Center opened the Walter Reade Theater and began year-round programming. The project was the crowning achievement of longtime executive director Joanne Koch, who hired Richard Peña in 1988 as program director, overseeing the year-round programming as well as heading the New York Film Festival’s selection committee. In his remarkable 25-year career, Peña widened the international scope of Film at Lincoln Center, through his own capacious approach and vast knowledge, and through enduring partnerships such as the New York African Film Festival, founded in 1993 by Mahen Bonetti and presented annually at the Walter Reade Theater. The first edition of the festival launched with the New York premiere of Ousmane Sembene’s Guelwaar, a seriocomic political drama about the mysterious death of a Christian leader and political activist in Senegal whose body goes missing before his funeral, and whose corpse is mistaken for a man interred at an Islamic cemetery.",4:00 p.m.,"MoMA, Floor T2/T1, Theater 2

A lively, bittersweet portrait of 1960s France.","Adieu Philippine. 1962. France/Italy. Directed by Jacques Rozier. Screenplay by Rozier, Michèle O’Glor. With Jean-Claude Aimini, Daniel Descamps, Stefania Sabatini, Yveline Céry. DCP. 4K restoration courtesy of Janus Films. In French; English subtitles. 106 min.

Florence Almozini became Film at Lincoln Center’s senior director of programming in 2022, overseeing a team that includes Tyler Wilson, Daniel Sullivan, and Maddie Whittle. The 2024 series Jacques Rozier, Chronicler of Summer, including all five of the director’s features, brought long-overdue attention to this key yet relatively neglected filmmaker. Film at Lincoln Center called Adieu Philippine “an overlooked gem of the French New Wave. Rozier satirizes several major cultural currents of early-1960s France: political blindness, romantic escapism, and commercial corruption. Young Michel (Jean-Claude Aimini) works as a camera technician for a television studio, where he meets two would-be actresses, Liliane (Yveline Céry) and Juliette (Stefania Sabatini).... With confidence and panache, Rozier expertly employs documentary-style shooting, improvisational acting (among a mostly nonprofessional cast), and kinetic montage sequences to capture the disparity between blithe youth and the societal pressures—especially Michel’s imminent military service in Algeria—that threaten its innocence.”", 7:00 p.m.,"MoMA, Floor T2/T1, Theater 2

Timed to coincide with the release of High Life, starring Robert Pattinson, BAM’s 2019 series Strange Desires: The Films of Claire Denis was the largest US retrospective to date of her work. In their series description, BAM wrote, “One of a handful of filmmakers who can credibly lay claim to the title of World’s Greatest Living Director, Claire Denis creates films that speak as much through movement, rhythm, and texture as they do through words.” In 35 Shots of Rum, a loving reinvention of Yasujirō Ozu’s Late Spring (1946), Denis transplants the poignant story of an aging widower and his growing daughter to modern-day Paris, paying homage to the great Japanese director while creating a deeply moving character study and mood piece that fits in perfectly with Denis’s body of work.",4:00 p.m.,"MoMA, Floor T2/T1, Theater 2

The first feature film made in Jamaica by Jamaicans, The Harder They Come starred Jimmy Cliff as a musician and gangster hero. The movie was released in 1973 to respectable reviews but virtually no box office success. In an interview for Ben Davis’s book Repertory Movie Theaters of New York City, Elgin manager Chuck Zlatkin said “The Harder They Come had a lot of good elements to it. We threw it on a Sunday one-day showing, and the thing went through the roof. And that’s when we turned it into a midnight show that ran forever.” Playing continuously from October 1974 till March 1977, when the theater closed, it was the longest-running midnight movie in the theater’s history. Describing the film’s appeal, Zlatkin said, “It has reggae music. It makes a political statement, it gives a realistic look into another culture. It’s not the Jamaica you see in travel brochures. And it’s basically done like an old James Cagney film.”",6:30 p.m.,"MoMA, Floor T2/T1, Theater 2

Directed by Raoul Walsh,https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/10622,"The Big Trail (1930), John Wayne’s first starring role, is a visually stunning western epic about pioneers on the Oregon Trail. Shot in Fox’s widescreen Grandeur process, Raoul Walsh’s film remains a landmark of early cinematic ambition.","The Big Trail. 1930. USA. Directed by Raoul Walsh. Screenplay by Marie Boyle, Jack Peabody, Florence Postal, Fred Sersen. With John Wayne, Ward Bond, Marguerite Churchill. 35mm. Restored with funding from the Celeste Bartos Fund for Film Preservation and the Film Foundation. 122 min.

With John Wayne in his first starring role, the epic western The Big Trail, about pioneers on the Oregon Trail, was a highlight of MoMA’s comprehensive Raoul Walsh retrospective in 1974. In the 1980s, the Museum’s preservation chief, Peter Williamson, led the restoration of this spectacular film, which was shot in Fox’s 70mm Grandeur process. For a 2012 presentation at Cinema Ritrovato in Bologna, MoMA film curator Dave Kehr wrote, “For Walsh, who had been developing a distinctive mise-en-scène based on contrasting fore­ground and background action, as well as an elaborate choreography of actors and extras entering and leaving the frame, the Grandeur process, with its widescreen image and vast depth of field, must have seemed custom made for him. Walsh seems immediately to seize all of the pos­sibilities of the widescreen format, creat­ing a continuous sense of movement with the frames that makes the action (and the world of the movie) extend even further beyond the edges of the already extended screen. The film is also perhaps the first of Walsh’s ‘map movies’ in which the existential objective is to move a group of men from point x to point y, with all of the attendant dangers in between. In The Big Trail, of course, this movement is nothing less than the settling of the American West, here real­ized with a scale and immediacy that re­mains unique.”",1:00 p.m.,"MoMA, Floor T2/T1, Theater 1

Jackson, powerfully brings James Baldwin’s unfinished work to life—exploring race in America through the lives of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr.","I Am Not Your Negro. 2016. USA. Directed by Raoul Peck. Narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. DCP courtesy of Kino Lorber. In English. 95 min.

Ahead of its February 2017 regular theatrical release, Raoul Peck’s documentary I Am Not Your Negro had an exclusive run in December 2016 at the Maysles Documentary Center, selling out every screening. Announcing the screening, the MDC wrote: “Working from the text of James Baldwin’s unfinished final novel, director Raoul Peck (Death of a Prophet, Lumumba, Fatal Assistance, Murder in Pacot) creates a stunning meditation on what it means to be Black in America. In 1979, James Baldwin wrote a letter to his literary agent describing his new endeavour: the writing of his final book, Remember This House, recounting the lives and successive assassinations of his friends Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Baldwin was not able to complete the book before his death, and the unfinished manuscript was entrusted to director Raoul Peck by the writer's estate. Built exclusively around Baldwin's words, Peck’s I Am Not Your Negro delves into the complex legacy of three lives (and deaths) that permanently marked the American social and political landscape. Framing the unfinished work as a radical narration about race in America, Peck matches Baldwin’s lyrical rhetoric with rich archival footage of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, and connects these historical struggles for justice and equality to present-day movements.”",4:00 p.m.,"MoMA, Floor T2/T1, Theater 2

Written by Jean-Luc Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville. With Sandrine Battistella, Pierre Oudrey, Alexandre Rignault, Rachel Stefanopoli, Jean-Luc Godard. DCP courtesy of Contemporary Films. 88 min.

In 1977 the Bleecker Street Cinema’s French-American programmer Jackie Raynal invited film critic Serge Daney, then editor of Cahiers du cinéma, to program and present a weeklong program of films championed by the French magazine. The program included Chantal Akerman’s News from Home, Wim Wenders’s Kings of the Road, and Jean-Marie Straub and Daniele Huillet’s Fortini/Cani, as well as several films by Jean-Luc Godard. Godard, who was politically and artistically radicalized in 1968, experimented with film and video to make Numéro deux, a wide-ranging home movie cum essay film. The title suggests a desire to reinvent his approach to cinema, and referring to its difference from Breathess (À bout de souffle), he said, “It’s another location in my history and in the history of cinema, which is itself a part of my history and my life. The camera is not a pen for writing, a gun for shooting. Numéro deux, it’s thinking a second time about the film made 15 years ago.""",1:30 p.m.,"MoMA, Floor T2/T1, Theater 2

In Japanese with English subtitles. 87 min.

Cinema 16 opened their fall 1961 season with the New York premiere of Nagisa Ōshima’s third film, The Sun’s Burial. In his program description, Vogel declared, “This sensational film—a paroxysm of violence and eroticism—is the work of Japan’s foremost ‘New Wave’ director, Nagisa Ōshima. Signalling the emergence of a new generation in Japanese films, it explodes with the anger and fury of their rebellion, and reveals, beneath its squalor and brutality, a deep—and hopeless—humanism. [Luis] Buñuel himself seems challenged in this inexorable tale of terror, murder and depravity, enacted by racketeers, whores, robbers, agitators and thugs amidst the slums and industrial wastelands of Tokyo. Elliptical continuity, disjointed editing and haunting images both express and reinforce its basic themes: societal decline; corruption by money, power and poverty; perversion of the innocent; victimization of the guilty.”",4:00 p.m.,"MoMA, Floor T2/T1, Theater 2

Presented at Light Industry in 2009 by guest programmer Ginger Brooks Takahashi, the film will be shown here in a newly restored version with two intermissions.

In 1974 film exhibitor Sid Geffen and his wife, the French-born filmmaker and editor Jackie Raynal, took over the Bleecker Street Cinema (which was opened by Lionel Rogosin in 1960) a year after they reopened and began programming the Carnegie Hall Cinema. Geffen told the Village Voice that the Bleecker Street programming would be “adapted to a neighborhood heavily influenced by New York University,” and indeed the theater made a policy of showing films by young independent filmmakers. In 1981 they opened Jim Jarmusch’s first feature, Permanent Vacation, in their small second theater, the James Agee Room, which was only equipped to show 16mm. This laconic feature, an embryonic form of Jarmusch’s later films, stands out today as a vivid time capsule of hollowed-out, pre-gentrification Soho. It follows the drifting days and nights of its teenage star, Chris Parker, whose real life is barely fictionalized in the film.

He has collaborated with many film organizations throughout the city, including L’Alliance New York, where he worked with past curator Marie Losier in the early 2000s, and then with his predecessor, Delphine Selles-Alvarez, who continues to program the annual Animation First festival (with Cinema Manager Chloe Dheu). This program includes two short films, and a new restoration of The Bad Son, directed by Claude Sautet, an important French filmmaker whose works are rarely shown at other venues in the city.

Signalling the emergence of a new generation in Japanese films, it explodes with the anger and fury of their rebellion, and reveals, beneath its squalor and brutality, a deep—and hopeless—humanism.

Fernando de Fuentes’s adaptation of Venezuelan author Rómulo Gallegos’ novel is a key breakthrough in Félix’s career—and the source of her enduring nickname, “La Doña.” Félix plays a landowner whose sexual victimization during adolescence creates a deep hostility toward men, and leads her to pursue entirely self-sufficient control over her ranch and the surrounding area. De Fuentes presents the psychological aspects of a character who operates as both villain and victim, allowing Félix to develop the type of strong female protagonist that would become her legacy in Latin American cinema.

Charles Chaplin considered this poignant comedy his greatest achievement, and audiences have agreed for nearly a century. As the Lone Prospector, the Little Tramp travels to the Klondike seeking fortune but instead finds hunger, isolation, and heartbreak.
