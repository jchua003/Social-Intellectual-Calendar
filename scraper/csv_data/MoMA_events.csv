This event is part of Whitten Talks: Artists on Artists, a series of conversations on the occasion of the exhibition _Jack Whitten: The Messenger_ in which contemporary artists reflect on Whitten’s pathbreaking exploration of race, technology, jazz, love, and war from the 1960s through to his legacy today. Please join us for what will be illuminating conversations revealing what only artists see.

She is regularly commissioned to write for orchestra, instrumental and vocal ensembles, dance, and interdisciplinary theater. Joachim is an assistant professor of composition at Princeton University and a 2024–25 MoMA Scholar in Residence.
