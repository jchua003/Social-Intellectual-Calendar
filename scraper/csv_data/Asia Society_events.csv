Panel Discussion,"July 1, 2025",China's Changing Religious Landscape,https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/events/chinas-changing-religious-landscape,Join us for a virtual panel discussion on how China’s religious rejuvenation is reshaping communities and refashioning the relationship between Chinese citizens and the state.,"More people in China are taking up religious and devotional practices. As they do, they form local organizations that provide a communal identity at the margins of Party control and influence. Karl Marx believed that religion would “wither away” as people’s material needs were met, but increasing prosperity has instead provided many with the resources and leisure for spiritual pursuits and other methods of self-cultivation.

Join the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis (CCA) for a virtual panel on how China’s religious rejuvenation is reshaping communities and refashioning the relationship between Chinese citizens and the state, featuring Mayfair Yang, Professor, University of California-Santa Barbara; Gareth Fisher, Associate Professor, Syracuse University; and John Osburg, CCA Fellow on Chinese Society and Associate Professor, University of Rochester. CCA Fellow G.A. Donovan will moderate the discussion.",12 - 1 p.m. New York Time,Online
Performance,"July 7, 2025",725 Salon: Chun Wai Chan,https://asiasociety.org/center-us-china-relations/events/725-salon-chun-wai-chan,"At this special salon event, Chun Wai Chan, the first Chinese principal dancer of the New York City Ballet will perform classic ballet excerpts live and share insights into the movements and emotional expression behind his work and life.","Ballet, a traditional art form that originated in Europe, has long seen little representation from Chinese dancers. That changed in 2022 when Chun Wai Chan, then not yet 30, became the first Chinese principal dancer in the 74-year history of the New York City Ballet—breaking a long-standing barrier. In a feature titled “Princes Can Be Asian, Too,” The New York Times praised him for “shattering the glass ceiling of the ballet world.”

Chun Wai Chan didn’t grow up in a Western cultural environment. Born in Huizhou, Guangdong, he made it to the finals of the prestigious Prix de Lausanne in Switzerland at the age of 18 and was awarded a full scholarship to study in the U.S. He began his career at the Houston Ballet, and through talent, discipline, and determination, rose to the heart of the New York City Ballet stage—bringing greater visibility to Chinese dancers around the world.

At this special salon event, Chun Wai Chan will not only perform classic ballet excerpts live, but also share insights into the movements and emotional expression behind them. He’ll guide the audience through the unique way ballet tells stories and conveys feeling through body language.

This event will be conducted in Chinese with AI-translated English subtitles. ",6:30 - 8:30 p.m.,"725 Park Ave New York, NY 10021"
