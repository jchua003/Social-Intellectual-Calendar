This edition features West Hansen, MN’12, to present Canary in the Coal Mine: Kayaking the Entire Northwest Passage:

The Drake Passage and the Panama Canal have been the only two shipping routes between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; one treacherous and the other a perpetual bottleneck. For centuries, traders sought the elusive Northwest Passage made infamous by the death of 129 men on Sir John Franklin’s HMS Erebus and Terror. Now, our kayak team successfully completed the route, without support in less than 100 days, signaling the opening of the fastest, safest and soon to be busiest route between the world’s two largest oceans.",,
