      "description": "Crooklyn. 1994. USA. Directed by Spike Lee. Screenplay by Joie Susannah Lee, Cinqu\u00e9 Lee, and Spike Lee. With Alfre Woodard, Delroy Lindo, Spike Lee, Zelda Harris. 35mm print courtesy NBC/Universal. In English. 115 min. Although the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Fort Greene has a history of repertory programming dating back to the 1970s, the performing arts organization made a major commitment to year-round cinema under the leadership of Harvey Lichtenstein and Karen Brooks Hopkins, founding the four-screen BAMCinema in 1998, with three screens devoted to arthouse programming and one, the BAMCinematek, to repertory screenings and festivals. With consulting programmers Dan Talbot and Adrienne Mancia, and the full-time programmer Florence Almozini, BAM quickly established itself as one of the city\u2019s most important film venues. Past programmers include Jacob Perlin, Nellie Killian, Gabriel Caroti, David Reilly, Ashley Clarke, and Gina Duncan (who was also BAM president). The current head of programming is Jesse Trussell. Spike Lee\u2014who is not just one of the world\u2019s most prolific and singular directors but was also a long-time Fort Greene resident who established his company 40 Acres and a Mule in the neighborhood\u2014has been a frequent guest at BAM. He was the subject of the 1999 retrospective that opened BAM Cinematek, and another retrospective in 2014. Crooklyn, his most directly personal film, and among his most beautiful (with widescreen cinematography by Arthur Jafa), is a childhood memoir about growing up in Fort Greene, cowritten by Spike Lee with his sister Joie Susannah Lee and brother Cinqu\u00e9 Lee.",

      "description": "La Folie Almayer (Almayer's Folly). 2011. Belgium/France. Directed by Chantal Akerman. Screenplay by Akerman, based on the novel by Joseph Conrad. With Stanislas Merhar, Aurora Marion, Marc Barbe. 35mm print courtesy Royal Film Archive of Belgium. In French and English, with subtitles. 127 min. The Museum of the Moving Image launched First Look, its annual festival of formally inventive new international cinema, in 2012. Programmed by Dennis Lim, Rachael Rakes, and chief curator David Schwartz, the 2012 edition opened with Almayer\u2019s Folly, directed by Chantal Akerman, who was the subject of a complete film retrospective at MoMI in 1997. Of Almayer\u2019s Folly, Schwartz wrote: \u201cAkerman\u2019s masterful and mesmerizing Almayer\u2019s Folly freely adapts Joseph Conrad\u2019s first novel. A European trader\u2019s dreams of striking it rich in Malaysia have faded; all he has is his ruptured relationship with his half-Malay daughter. From its straddling opening\u2014the stabbing of an entertainer at an outdoor music bar to Dean Martin\u2019s \u2018Sway\u2019\u2014the film unfolds with trancelike power. Beautifully photographed in thick jungle terrain, Almayer\u2019s Folly synthesizes the long-take formalism of Akerman\u2019s earlier work with the spontaneity of her documentaries; it is as much influenced by F. W. Murnau and Robert Flaherty\u2019s Tabu as it is by Conrad.\u201d Other directors featured on First Look opening nights include Bruno Dumont (Outside Satan), Alexandre Rockwell (Little Feet), Jessica Hausner (Amour Fou), Alexander Sokurov (Francofonia), Hirokazu Kore-eda (After the Storm), Blake Williams (PROTOTYPE), and Serge Loznitsa (Donbass).",

      "title": "OVER THE GREAT WALL, A CENTURY APART",
      "description": "The Great Wall of Two Williams: Two Journeys, One Century Mission William Geil, the first person to explore the Great Wall of China, photograph its various morphologies and architectures, and document his experiences in a book about the structure, died unexpectedly, 100 years ago in 1925. His wife, Constance, buried him in the local Doylestown cemetery. His headstone reads \u2018William Edgar Geil, October 1st, 1865 \u2013 April 23rd, 1925\u2019 \u2014 and nothing else. Constance, so bereaved, sealed up her husband\u2019s study. It remained locked, until 1959. After Constance\u2019s death, her daughter readied the family mansion to sell: a house contents sale was held, and the details of the first Great Wall of China exploration from one end to the other, were sold, disseminated \u2014 and seemingly lost \u2014- until now. \u2018The Great Wall of Two Williams: Two Journeys, One Century Mission\u2019 is the decades-long story telling the revival of William Geil\u2019s legacy, by William Lindesay OBE, a Great Wall explorer himself. William Geil traversed the line of the Great Wall\u2019s ruins in 1908, from East to West. William Lindesay traversed the Great Wall, on foot, from West to East, in 1987. The two men met \u2018coincidentally\u2019, by choosing to take photographs in the same place \u2014 79 years apart. But the Wall view wasn\u2019t quite the same in the later photograph. Much of it had been razed to the ground. This perchance \u2018meeting\u2019 of the two explorers by the placing of their photographs together as a pair, showing changes, made Lindesay realise the latent importance of Geil\u2019s greater archive: it preserved a more complete and longer Great Wall than the one he had \u2018just\u2019 traversed. Just a few years before the centenary of William Geil\u2019s Great Wall journey, starting 2003, Lindesay set out on his mission to utilize Geil\u2019s archive in a bid to awaken China\u2019s consciousness by evidencing how the 20th century had unleashed a procession of onslaughts that had accelerated the ruinous condition of the Wall. He ended up spending five years searching for the views of the monument that the veteran explorer had captured in all of its pre-war and pre-revolution glory. His goal was to show what had been lost, in the hope that \u2018their\u2019 results \u2014 \u2018then\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019 photo pairs, placed side-by-side \u2014 would move minds and muscles enough to inspire systematic conservation efforts in the 21st Century, in order to offset the gamut of tragedies that had befallen the Wall during the 20th. This mammoth \u2018rephotographic\u2019 work proved to be only half of the two Williams\u2019 cooperative story. Lindesay had become increasingly concerned about by the neglect of Geil\u2019s legacy. How, why, he wondered, had William Geil\u2019s achievement been overlooked, seemingly forgotten? With the centenary of Geil\u2019s historic journey less than six months away, in summer 2008, he intensified his efforts to find members of the Geil family, if any, and, most importantly, tried to discover what had happened to the explorers elusive field notes, photographs and maps. Lindesay\u2019s first breakthrough came as a result of \u2018e-mailshots\u2019\u2014 his random method came up trumps paid as he made contact with the grandsons of William Geil. And rather than Lindesay \u2018finding\u2019 Geil\u2019s materials himself, the materials \u2018found\u2019 him, thanks to a large online presence of reports about the influential \u2018Wall of Two Williams\u2019 rephotography project in China. Lindesay was thus alerted to the donation of boxes of Geil\u2019s records and possessions to the Doylestown Historical Society, and he so he embarked on his pilgrimage to the Pennsylvanian town. In June 2008 Lindesay organized a commemorative ceremony at Geil\u2019s graveside, and became the first and only Great Wall Studies scholar to examine the papers. Exhibitions across China followed, as did books published on three continents. A century after William Geil\u2019s death in 1925, William Lindesay will be in the United States in June 2025 to deliver this fascinating \u2018international\u2019 Great Wall story. His vivid presentation features engaging storytelling, both stunning \u2014 and shocking \u2014 photographs, and moving videos \u2014 all to honour the legacy of William Geil (1865-1925), a forgotten great American explorer.",

In French and Wolof with English subtitles. 115 min. Presented by Film at Lincoln Center (formerly the Film Society of Lincoln Center), the prestigious New York Film Festival was founded in 1963. It was not until 1991 that Film at Lincoln Center opened the Walter Reade Theater and began year-round programming. The project was the crowning achievement of longtime executive director Joanne Koch, who hired Richard Pe\u00f1a in 1988 as program director, overseeing the year-round programming as well as heading the New York Film Festival\u2019s selection committee. In his remarkable 25-year career, Pe\u00f1a widened the international scope of Film at Lincoln Center, through his own capacious approach and vast knowledge, and through enduring partnerships such as the New York African Film Festival, founded in 1993 by Mahen Bonetti and presented annually at the Walter Reade Theater. The first edition of the festival launched with the New York premiere of Ousmane Sembene\u2019s Guelwaar, a seriocomic political drama about the mysterious death of a Christian leader and political activist in Senegal whose body goes missing before his funeral, and whose corpse is mistaken for a man interred at an Islamic cemetery.",

      "description": "The Big Trail. 1930. USA. Directed by Raoul Walsh. Screenplay by Marie Boyle, Jack Peabody, Florence Postal, Fred Sersen. With John Wayne, Ward Bond, Marguerite Churchill. 35mm. Restored with funding from the Celeste Bartos Fund for Film Preservation and the Film Foundation. 122 min. With John Wayne in his first starring role, the epic western The Big Trail, about pioneers on the Oregon Trail, was a highlight of MoMA\u2019s comprehensive Raoul Walsh retrospective in 1974. In the 1980s, the Museum\u2019s preservation chief, Peter Williamson, led the restoration of this spectacular film, which was shot in Fox\u2019s 70mm Grandeur process. For a 2012 presentation at Cinema Ritrovato in Bologna, MoMA film curator Dave Kehr wrote, \u201cFor Walsh, who had been developing a distinctive mise-en-sc\u00e8ne based on contrasting fore\u00adground and background action, as well as an elaborate choreography of actors and extras entering and leaving the frame, the Grandeur process, with its widescreen image and vast depth of field, must have seemed custom made for him. Walsh seems immediately to seize all of the pos\u00adsibilities of the widescreen format, creat\u00ading a continuous sense of movement with the frames that makes the action (and the world of the movie) extend even further beyond the edges of the already extended screen. The film is also perhaps the first of Walsh\u2019s \u2018map movies\u2019 in which the existential objective is to move a group of men from point x to point y, with all of the attendant dangers in between. In The Big Trail, of course, this movement is nothing less than the settling of the American West, here real\u00adized with a scale and immediacy that re\u00admains unique.\u201d",

      "description": "I Am Not Your Negro. 2016. USA. Directed by Raoul Peck. Narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. DCP courtesy of Kino Lorber. In English. 95 min. Ahead of its February 2017 regular theatrical release, Raoul Peck\u2019s documentary I Am Not Your Negro had an exclusive run in December 2016 at the Maysles Documentary Center, selling out every screening. Announcing the screening, the MDC wrote: \u201cWorking from the text of James Baldwin\u2019s unfinished final novel, director Raoul Peck (Death of a Prophet, Lumumba, Fatal Assistance, Murder in Pacot) creates a stunning meditation on what it means to be Black in America. In 1979, James Baldwin wrote a letter to his literary agent describing his new endeavour: the writing of his final book, Remember This House, recounting the lives and successive assassinations of his friends Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Baldwin was not able to complete the book before his death, and the unfinished manuscript was entrusted to director Raoul Peck by the writer's estate. Built exclusively around Baldwin's words, Peck\u2019s I Am Not Your Negro delves into the complex legacy of three lives (and deaths) that permanently marked the American social and political landscape. Framing the unfinished work as a radical narration about race in America, Peck matches Baldwin\u2019s lyrical rhetoric with rich archival footage of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, and connects these historical struggles for justice and equality to present-day movements.\u201d",

Cinema 16 opened their fall 1961 season with the New York premiere of Nagisa \u014cshima\u2019s third film, The Sun\u2019s Burial. In his program description, Vogel declared, \u201cThis sensational film\u2014a paroxysm of violence and eroticism\u2014is the work of Japan\u2019s foremost \u2018New Wave\u2019 director, Nagisa \u014cshima. Signalling the emergence of a new generation in Japanese films, it explodes with the anger and fury of their rebellion, and reveals, beneath its squalor and brutality, a deep\u2014and hopeless\u2014humanism. [Luis] Bu\u00f1uel himself seems challenged in this inexorable tale of terror, murder and depravity, enacted by racketeers, whores, robbers, agitators and thugs amidst the slums and industrial wastelands of Tokyo. Elliptical continuity, disjointed editing and haunting images both express and reinforce its basic themes: societal decline; corruption by money, power and poverty; perversion of the innocent; victimization of the guilty.\u201d",

The movie was released in 1973 to respectable reviews but virtually no box office success. In an interview for Ben Davis\u2019s book Repertory Movie Theaters of New York City, Elgin manager Chuck Zlatkin said \u201cThe Harder They Come had a lot of good elements to it.

In 1974 film exhibitor Sid Geffen and his wife, the French-born filmmaker and editor Jackie Raynal, took over the Bleecker Street Cinema (which was opened by Lionel Rogosin in 1960) a year after they reopened and began programming the Carnegie Hall Cinema. Geffen told the Village Voice that the Bleecker Street programming would be \u201cadapted to a neighborhood heavily influenced by New York University,\u201d and indeed the theater made a policy of showing films by young independent filmmakers. In 1981 they opened Jim Jarmusch\u2019s first feature, Permanent Vacation, in their small second theater, the James Agee Room, which was only equipped to show 16mm. This laconic feature, an embryonic form of Jarmusch\u2019s later films, stands out today as a vivid time capsule of hollowed-out, pre-gentrification Soho. It follows the drifting days and nights of its teenage star, Chris Parker, whose real life is barely fictionalized in the film. As the theater\u2019s newsletter described it, \u201cPermanent Vacation presents a chronicle of the new, lost, post-punk generation.\u201d",

At this special salon event, Chun Wai Chan will not only perform classic ballet excerpts live, but also share insights into the movements and emotional expression behind them.

      "description": "Our popular outdoor lecture series is back! The New York Historical is thrilled to once again partner with the Bryant Park Reading Room to present a series of free programs in the park. Charles Sumner is often remembered as the recipient of a brutal caning on the Senate floor from pro-slavery congressman Preston Brooks in 1856. However, his historical and political legacy encompasses much more than this singular moment in the lead-up to the Civil War. Author Zaakir Tameez offers a new perspective on Sumner, one of the most ardent proponents of multiracial democracy of his day, a key player in modern civil rights law, and a gay man at a time when homosexuality was neither accepted nor understood. Zaakir Tameez is a Fulbright Scholar and Humanity in Action Senior Fellow whose new book is Charles Sumner: Conscience of a Nation. This program is produced in partnership with the Bryant Park Corporation.",

With Hono Kayoko, Isso Sasaki, Masahiko Tsugawa. 35mm print courtesy the Japan Foundation, with the permission of Janus Films. In Japanese with English subtitles. 87 min. Cinema 16 opened their fall 1961 season with the New York premiere of Nagisa \u014cshima\u2019s third film, The Sun\u2019s Burial. In his program description, Vogel declared, \u201cThis sensational film\u2014a paroxysm of violence and eroticism\u2014is the work of Japan\u2019s foremost \u2018New Wave\u2019 director, Nagisa \u014cshima. Signalling the emergence of a new generation in Japanese films, it explodes with the anger and fury of their rebellion, and reveals, beneath its squalor and brutality, a deep\u2014and hopeless\u2014humanism. [Luis] Bu\u00f1uel himself seems challenged in this inexorable tale of terror, murder and depravity, enacted by racketeers, whores, robbers, agitators and thugs amidst the slums and industrial wastelands of Tokyo. Elliptical continuity, disjointed editing and haunting images both express and reinforce its basic themes: societal decline; corruption by money, power and poverty; perversion of the innocent; victimization of the guilty.\u201d",

With Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix, Fernando Soler, Juli\u00e1n Soler. In Spanish; English subtitles. DCP courtesy of Filmoteca UNAM. 100 min. Set in Mexico City during World War II, Tito Davison\u2019s espionage thriller features F\u00e9lix navigating a narrative of international intrigue in the dual role of Sof\u00eda/Lena Kovach. Using noir visual strategies to create an atmosphere of moral ambiguity, the film reflects Mexico\u2019s position during the global conflict: nominally neutral but increasingly aligned with Allied powers. The screenplay, by the prominent Mexican writer and political activist Jose Revueltas, gives F\u00e9lix a multifaceted characterization that combines vulnerability and strategic calculation. The production shows Mexican cinema\u2019s technical development and engagement with international trends, particularly the subjective, psychological approach and visual style of film noir. May God Forgive Me proved that F\u00e9lix could expand beyond melodrama, and established her as a strong but sympathetic presence in the thriller genre.",

      "description": "Photography has played a key role in structuring systems of power in society, including those related to crime and punishment. This exhibition presents immersive contemporary installations by the artist Jesse Krimes (American, b. 1982) alongside nineteenth-century photographs from The Met collection by the French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon, who developed the first modern system of criminal identification before the adoption of fingerprinting. Krimes\u2019s image-based installations, made over the course of his six-year incarceration, reflect the ingenuity of an artist working without access to traditional materials. Employing prison-issued soap, hair gel, playing cards, and newspaper he created works of art that seek to disrupt and recontextualize the circulation of photographs in the media. Displayed at The Met in dialogue with Bertillon, whose pioneering method paired anthropomorphic measurements with photographs to produce the present-day mug shot, Krimes\u2019s work raises questions about the perceived neutrality of our systems of identification and the hierarchies of social imbalance they create and reinscribe. An artist for whom collaboration and activism are vital, Krimes founded the Center for Art and Advocacy to highlight the talent and creative potential among individuals who have experienced incarceration and to support and improve outcomes for formerly incarcerated artists. The exhibition is made possible by Joyce Frank Menschel.",

De Fuentes presents the psychological aspects of a character who operates as both villain and victim, allowing F\u00e9lix to develop the type of strong female protagonist that would become her legacy in Latin American cinema. The film\u2019s treatment of rural power dynamics, sexual politics, and vengeance established F\u00e9lix as an actress who could move beyond conventional female roles, offering instead a vision of female autonomy seldom represented in the cinema of that time.",

Drawn from The Met\u2019s William L. Schaeffer Collection, major works by lauded artists such as Josiah Johnson Hawes, John Moran, Carleton Watkins, and Alice Austen are shown in dialogue with extraordinary photographs by obscure or unknown practitioners made in small towns and cities from coast to coast. Featuring a range of formats, from daguerreotypes and cartes de visite to stereographs and cyanotypes, the show explores the dramatic change in the nation\u2019s sense of itself that was driven by the immediate success of photography as a cultural, commercial, artistic, and psychological preoccupation. In 1835, even before the nearly simultaneous announcement of the invention of the new art in Paris and London, the American philosopher essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson noted with remarkable vision: \u201cOur Age is Ocular.\u201d The exhibition is made possible by the Diane W. and James E.

Gabriel Figueroa\u2019s cinematography presents the Indigenous Pur\u00e9pecha community as a setting where personal desires conflict with communal traditions and institutional power.

With Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix, V\u00edctor Junco, Crox Alvarado. In Spanish; English subtitles. DCP courtesy of Filmoteca UNAM. 98 min. Stung by a humiliating divorce, \u00c1ngela (Felix) resolves to turn seduction into a private sport: lure a man, break his heart, move on. Years later she crosses paths with Adri\u00e1n, a gambler as unscrupulous as she is\u2014only to watch him redirect his charm toward her unsuspecting daughter, Ang\u00e9lica. The triangle, unveiled in flashback after an opening-reel gunshot, recalls the mother-daughter antagonism of Michael Curtiz\u2019s Mildred Pierce (1945), but pushes the stakes further: \u00c1ngela\u2019s hard-won independence now threatens the one bond she hoped to keep untainted. Davison guides the drama with thunder-punctuated entrances and moody interior lighting, letting F\u00e9lix move from icy control to panic without losing her poise. The performance earned F\u00e9lix her third Ariel for Best Actress, and the picture\u2019s slot in the 1951 Cannes competition signalled the rising international prestige of Mexican cinema.",

With Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix, Fernando Soler. In Spanish; English subtitles. DCP courtesy of Filmoteca UNAM. 95 min. In this ambitious melodrama, adapted from Alphonse Daudet\u2019s 19th-century novel La raison sociale, Fernando de Fuentes directs F\u00e9lix as Teresa L\u00f3pez, an ambitious shop-girl who glimpses high society at a charity ball and decides beauty will be her ladder out of obscurity. One by one she wins, marries, and discards prosperous admirers, wrecking the Velasco-Ferrer family in the process and discovering that the top rung can be as lonely as the bottom. De Fuentes, working again with F\u00e9lix after Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara, creates a study of ambition, class mobility, and power dynamics. F\u00e9lix keeps Teresa charismatic yet opaque, letting the audience decide whether her ruthlessness is vice, survival instinct, or both.",

Preserved and restored by The Museum of Modern Art. 65 min. Walter Ruttmann\u2019s landmark city symphony transforms a day in the life of Weimar-era Berlin into a percussive visual poem. Beginning with the arrival of a morning train and concluding in nightfall, the film\u2019s five-act structure follows the metropolis from dawn to dusk, capturing the pulsing energy of urban modernity through dazzling montage sequences. Cinematographer Karl Freund\u2019s roving camera moves fluidly through factories, boulevards, caf\u00e9 es, and nightclubs, capturing the mechanical rhythms and social strata of a city in transformation. Neither strictly documentary nor avant-garde experiment, Ruttmann\u2019s masterpiece synthesizes abstract formalism with documentary observation, creating a hypnotic portrait of industrial society that influenced generations of filmmakers from Dziga Vertov to Godfrey Reggio.",

      "description": "Traditional narratives of religion in North America begin with the arrival of English settlers, bypassing the 10,000 years of religious practice that predated the pilgrims and had an enormous impact on the development of the continent. Historian Thomas A. Tweed illuminates the histories of Native American, African American, and European American religious traditions in North America, as well as their complex interactions, to provide a fascinating and prescient look at the spiritual practices that have shaped the continent. Thomas A. Tweed is the Harold and Martha Welch Professor of American Studies and professor of history at the University of Notre Dame, as well as the author, most recently, of Religion: A Very Short Introduction and Religion in the Lands that Became America: A New History.",

      "description": "The Gold Rush. 1925. USA. Written and directed by Charles Chaplin. With Chaplin, Georgia Hale, Mack Swain, Tom Murray. Restored by L\u2019immagine Ritrovato, Bologna, and the Association Chaplin. DCP courtesy of Janus Films. US restoration premiere. 95 min. Charles Chaplin considered this poignant comedy his greatest achievement, and audiences have agreed for nearly a century. As the Lone Prospector, the Little Tramp travels to the Klondike seeking fortune but instead finds hunger, isolation, and heartbreak. From this premise, Chaplin crafted some of cinema\u2019s most enduring sequences: \u2013 the starving prospector eating his shoe with the delicacy of a gourmet, the cabin teetering on a cliff\u2019s edge, and the unforgettable \u201c\"dance of the dinner rolls.\u201d\" Yet beyond these iconic moments lies a remarkable synthesis of pathos and comedy that showcases Chaplin\u2019s genius for transforming hardship into transcendent art. This meticulous restoration from L\u2019Immagine Ritrovato recreates the original 1925 release version, before Chaplin\u2019s 1942 sound revision. Drawing from pristine elements held by multiple archives including MoMA, the restoration team has achieved unprecedented visual clarity, revealing nuances in Chaplin\u2019s performance and the production\u2019s detailed craftsmanship. Freed from decades of duplications and degradations, The Gold Rush emerges anew, its emotional resonance and comedic brilliance fully intact.",
