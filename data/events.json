      "description": "Dispatches from the Field, a new digital program designed to bring The Explorers Club community closer—wherever you are. Each session kicks off with a 10-minute talk from a Featured Speaker, streamed live to the public on explorers.org and our YouTube channel. This will be followed by Campfire sessions—intimate, Members-Only breakout groups where you can connect, share ideas, and build relationships. This edition features West Hansen, MN’12, to present Canary in the Coal Mine: Kayaking the Entire Northwest Passage: The Drake Passage and the Panama Canal have been the only two shipping routes between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; one treacherous and the other a perpetual bottleneck. For centuries, traders sought the elusive Northwest Passage made infamous by the death of 129 men on Sir John Franklin’s HMS Erebus and Terror. Now, our kayak team successfully completed the route, without support in less than 100 days, signaling the opening of the fastest, safest and soon to be busiest route between the world’s two largest oceans.",

      "description": "In conjunction with the exhibition Hilma af Klint: What Stands Behind the Flowers, our July Drop-in Drawing sessions will be held in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden. These drop-in sessions will feature self-guided nature-journaling prompts written by botanist Lena Struwe and inspired by Hilma af Klint’s practice of sustained attention to nature. Nature journaling is an easy way to get inspired by the natural discovery of small and large experiences wherever you are. Using your eyes, ears, and other senses and making sketches and written notes to create a journal page, you will learn how to see more everywhere, ask questions about it, and connect your observations to your memories and previous knowledge. Anyone can nature journal. Explore nature in this relaxed drop-in session for all ages. Materials and seating are provided. Participation is open to all, with no experience, ability, or reservations required. In addition to self-guided prompts, this session will feature short, artist-led demos/lessons throughout the evening. Drawing prompts will be available in English and Spanish. In the event of rain or high temperatures Drop-in Drawing will be held in Gallery 400. Drop-in Drawing is part of UNIQLO Friday Nights, when MoMA is open late every Friday night, and admission is free for all New York State residents. Dr. Lena Struwe is director of the Chrysler Herbarium and a professor at the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University, where she teaches evolution, botany, biodiversity, and nature journaling. She has over 35 years of broad scientific research, community engagement, and teaching experience.",

In celebration of the exhibition Hilma af Klint: What Stands Behind the Flowers we invite you to delve into Hilma af Klint’s explorations of nature and spirituality through a three-part lecture series. This lecture series engages Hilma af Klint’s unique archive of botanical drawings to explore questions fundamental to histories of modern art. Through a close discussion of af Klint’s unique and compelling project, we will visit the borders between art and science, and we will test the divisions between scientific rationality and visionary intuition. Fundamentally, we will come to understand the importance of Hilma af Klint’s contributions at the frontiers of these powerful interpretive frameworks.",

      "description": "Join the acclaimed composers-performers Nathalie Joachim and George Lewis as they reflect on Jack Whitten’s deep engagement with jazz as a method for artistic expression. They will consider the role of improvisation in his practice, the meaning of music for Whitten, and what they see in the artist’s work as composers and musicians. This event is part of Whitten Talks: Artists on Artists, a series of conversations on the occasion of the exhibition _Jack Whitten: The Messenger_ in which contemporary artists reflect on Whitten’s pathbreaking exploration of race, technology, jazz, love, and war from the 1960s through to his legacy today. Please join us for what will be illuminating conversations revealing what only artists see. Nathalie Joachim is a Grammy-nominated performer and composer committed to storytelling as a form of human connection and cultural awareness. She is regularly commissioned to write for orchestra, instrumental and vocal ensembles, dance, and interdisciplinary theater. Joachim is an assistant professor of composition at Princeton University and a 2024–25 MoMA Scholar in Residence. George Lewis is an acclaimed American composer, musicologist, and trombonist. He is the Edwin H. Case Professor of American Music and Area Chair in Composition at Columbia University and the artistic director of the International Contemporary Ensemble. His scholarship considers the history and criticism of experimental music, computer music, interactive media, and improvisation, and their entanglement with the dynamics of race, gender, and decolonization.

      "description": "Experience the serenity of an exclusive tour of MoMA before the museum opens to the public. Join your professional art-historian guide on a relaxing stroll through the galleries and connect on a deeper level with the works on display. Tours meet in the early morning, and you’ll get a full hour of exclusive access to the galleries via a private entrance. With your guide and a small group, you can take advantage of the morning’s peace and tranquility to look more deeply at works that typically draw larger crowds of visitors, while taking in fascinating facts and anecdotes about the artists and their techniques. This program is not part of Member Early Hours. Museum admission included in the cost of the tour. Afterward, explore MoMA’s six floors of galleries at your leisure. Discover an extensive range of modern and contemporary art, ranging from European painting and sculpture of the 1880s to contemporary film, design, and performance art. Admire famous works of modern art like Claude Monet’s Water Lilies, Pablo Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, Henri Matisse’s Dance (I), and Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s Soup Cans alongside contemporary pieces by Elizabeth Murray, Cindy Sherman, Ai Weiwei, and many others.",

Nature journaling is an easy way to get inspired by the natural discovery of small and large experiences wherever you are. Using your eyes, ears, and other senses and making sketches and written notes to create a journal page, you will learn how to see more everywhere, ask questions about it, and connect your observations to your memories and previous knowledge. Anyone can nature journal. Explore nature in this relaxed drop-in session for all ages. Materials and seating are provided. Participation is open to all, with no experience, ability, or reservations required. In addition to self-guided prompts, this session will feature short, artist-led demos/lessons throughout the evening. Drawing prompts will be available in English and Spanish. In the event of rain or high temperatures Drop-in Drawing will be held in Gallery 400. Drop-in Drawing is part of UNIQLO Friday Nights, when MoMA is open late every Friday night, and admission is free for all New York State residents. Dr. Lena Struwe is director of the Chrysler Herbarium and a professor at the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University, where she teaches evolution, botany, biodiversity, and nature journaling.

      "description": "Experience the serenity of an exclusive tour of MoMA before the museum opens to the public. Join your professional art-historian guide on a relaxing stroll through the galleries and connect on a deeper level with the works on display. Tours meet in the early morning, and you’ll get a full hour of exclusive access to the galleries via a private entrance. With your guide and a small group, you can take advantage of the morning’s peace and tranquility to look more deeply at works that typically draw larger crowds of visitors, while taking in fascinating facts and anecdotes about the artists and their techniques. This program is not part of Member Early Hours. Museum admission included in the cost of the tour. Afterward, explore MoMA’s six floors of galleries at your leisure. Discover an extensive range of modern and contemporary art, ranging from European painting and sculpture of the 1880s to contemporary film, design, and performance art. Admire famous works of modern art like Claude Monet’s Water Lilies, Pablo Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, Henri Matisse’s Dance (I), and Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s Soup Cans alongside contemporary pieces by Elizabeth Murray, Cindy Sherman, Ai Weiwei, and many others.",

He received The Explorers Club’s prestigious Sweeney Medal in 2015, awarded to a member who has exhibited an outstanding interest in the welfare and objectives of the Club. He also served as the Club’s Treasurer in NYC for more than four years. Bruce was an indispensable member of ECWG’s Board of Directors from 1995 until he stepped down in December 2022, and he served with distinction as ECWG’s Treasurer for 25 years, for which he was honored in May 2023 and received the title of ECWG Treasurer Emeritus. Bruce was born on a little horse cavalry post in the Philippines and grew up on several Army posts. He received S.B. and S.M. Civil Engineering degrees from MIT, followed by 48 years in The U.S. Department of the Interior, and staff for the Cabinet level U.S. Water Resources Council. He served in several Senior Executive positions in Interior, including as Director of the Secretary’s Office of Environmental Project Review, where he provided advice on hundreds of significant environmental issues; as Deputy Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; and as Special Assistant for Tribal Self Governance.

      "description": "Karli Frigge (1943–) is one of the world’s most prominent and innovative paper marblers. From 1960 to 2000 she produced marbled papers and publications that are renowned for their innovation and creativity. The Magic of Marbling: The Art of Karli Frigge presents selections from Watson Library’s collection of her work including her sample books, recipe books, instruction guides, and workbooks. Frigge studied bookbinding at the Graphic School in Holland and the Rotterdam Academy of Decorative Arts (now the William de Kooning Academy) under Dieuweke Kollweijn, a preeminent Dutch bookbinder. Frigge has distributed and published examples of her marbling in numerous limited-edition formats. Her most recent publication from 2023 is titled Set of Historical Marbled Papers. This extraordinary collection brings together a selection of her marbled papers made between 1974 and 1998 and serves as a retrospective including her signature patterns: landscape, tiger eye, and alchemy marbles. Watson Library’s collection of Karli Frigge’s work is part of a larger outstanding collection on the history of papermaking and decorated paper. The collection was enhanced in 2016 by a significant donation of four hundred and fifty books from Mary Schlosser. In 2018, Mindell Dubansky, Museum Librarian for Conservation and Preservation, started a Paper Legacy Collection that now holds the work of more than fifty American decorated paper artists active from the 1960s to 2000s. That collection includes extensive paper samples, publications, tools, recipe books, and personal correspondence. The exhibition of Karli Frigge’s work is complemented by Frigge’s vivid, inspirational quotes about the practice of marbling and by insightful comments from Sidney E. Berger, Frigge’s biographer. His comprehensive account, Karli Frigge’s Life in Marbling, is on display in the exhibition.",
